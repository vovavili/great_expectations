Stay informed about the health of the Data Assets that you care about by enabling alerts in GX Cloud. 

## Email alert default settings

Email alerts are configured on a per-user basis; your email alert settings do not affect the email alerts of other users in your organization.

By default, alerts are enabled for you for every Data Asset you create and disabled for all Data Assets created by others. You can change these settings at any time.

Every time a Data Asset fails a validation run, GX Cloud sends an email to all users who have enabled alerts for that Data Asset.



## Update an email alert

1. In GX Cloud, click **Data Assets**.
2. Click a Data Asset in the **Data Assets** list.
3. Click the **Expectations** tab and then **Alerts**.
4. Click the **toggle switch** to enable or disable email alerts for the Data Asset.

If you disabled an alert, you will stop receiving emails for the Data Asset immediately. If you enabled an alert, you will begin receiving the emails as soon as the Data Assetâ€™s next full validation run is complete.
