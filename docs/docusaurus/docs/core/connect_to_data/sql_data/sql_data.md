To connect to your SQL data, you first create a Data Source which tells GX where your database resides and how to connect to it.  You then configure Data Assets for your Data Source to tell GX which sets of records you want to be able to access from your Data Source.  Finally, you will define Batch Definitions which allow you to request all the records retrieved from a Data Asset or further partition the returned records based on the contents of a date and time field.

GX supports the following SQL dialects:

- PostgreSQL
- SQLite
- Snowflake
- Databricks SQL
- BigQuery SQL

All other SQL dialects are handled through the python module `SQLAlchemy`.  You can find more information on the dialects supported by `SQLAlchemy` on their [dialects](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/index.html) page.

## Configure credentials

## Create a SQL Data Source

Data Sources tell GX where your data is located and how to connect to it.  With SQL databases this is done through a connection string you will provide.
